Introduction:

This game is called Da Vinci Code. It is a board game originating from Germany.
In this game, there are 24 cards: 12 black and 12 white with numbers from 0 to 11.
Each person starts with four cards sorted numerically(when two cards have the same number, the black one is considered smaller), but the numbers are only visible to himself.
The players will take turns to draw a new card and guess the number of any one card of the other player.
If he guesses right, his opponent should show the card and he can choose to guess another card or stop temporarily.
If his answer is wrong, he should turn over the card he just drawed and back into his line according to the previous sorting rule.
Whoever makes the opponent show all his cards wins the game.
Sometimes, all of the cards are drawn before any one player showing all his cards.
Under this special circumstance, whoever owns more cards hidden wins the game.
